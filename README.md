# Pay Your Friend

"Pay Your Friend" was born out of one all-too-familiar scenario: fronting money for a night out, a meal, or a shared experience, only to spend the rest of the evening (or even the following days) chasing friends down for their share.

The inspiration behind this project comes from the frustration of having to remind, nudge, and sometimes even argue with friends about reimbursing the money fronted for group expenses. The idea was simple: why not create a tool that removes the awkwardness and hassle from these situations? Instead of spending time tracking down payments and dealing with the uncomfortable dynamics of money and friendship, "Pay Your Friend" automates the process.

This project is a tribute to those countless moments where friendship meets finances, aiming to:
- Simplify the process of splitting expenses.
- Provide a transparent, easy-to-use system for tracking who owes what.
- Eliminate the awkward conversations and reminders associated with money matters.

At its core, "Pay Your Friend" is about preserving the joy and spontaneity of shared experiences without the afterthought of settling bills. It's a small innovation designed to help keep friendships strong, even when money is involved.
